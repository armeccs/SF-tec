Fines are a lien on income - as all electronic. Include cost of investigation/conviction, 
perp can overpay
discount for paying all off at once
Ai chooses the best level and adjusts it if perp's employment changes - looking for max repayment without discouraging earning
unemployed have benefit cut
if starts racking up faster than feasible to repay, then prison - still get the benefit paying off fines 
(cost of prison is tax-payer funded)
Some perps do crowd funding

Investigations by humans are costed like accountants
Costs a lot lower/speed faster due to use of AI

e.g. dog poo - genetic test, matched with d/b, fine imposed by email (cf traffic violation)
Can't match? then build up the offences until match offender (CCTV/drone/sat) - fine too for not regging

fine levels inc with repeat offenses
